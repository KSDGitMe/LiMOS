## Recommended Implementation Order

### Phase 1: Foundation (Completed)
‚úÖ REST API
‚úÖ CLI Tool
‚úÖ Test all endpoints
‚úÖ Document everything

### Phase 2: Voice/NLP (Recommended Next - 2 weeks)
**Why first:**
- Leverages existing code from Finance project
- Fastest to implement (2 weeks vs 6 weeks)
- Provides unique value (hands-free entry)
- Low maintenance
- Can start with simple iOS Shortcuts integration

**Quick Win:**
1. Week 1: Adapt existing Finance code to LiMOS API
2. Week 2: Create iOS Shortcut, test with user

### Phase 3: Web UI (3-6 weeks)
**Why second:**
- Provides visual dashboard
- Universal browser access
- Complements voice (voice for quick entry, web for analysis)
- Can share components with mobile app later

### Phase 4: Mobile App (6+ weeks)
**Why last:**
- Most complex
- Can reuse React components from Web UI
- By this point, API is battle-tested
- Can incorporate learnings from Web UI and Voice
