# Budget Envelope System - Implementation Summary

**Date:** 2025-01-08
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE
**Module:** LiMOS Accounting

---

## Overview

Successfully implemented a complete virtual envelope budgeting system for the LiMOS Accounting Module. The system provides expense tracking, liability payment management, and future balance forecasting while maintaining the fundamental equation: **Bank Balance = Budget Allocated + Payment Reserved + Available**.

  - 6 methods for expense tracking and forecasting
  - Support for 3 rollover policies: RESET, ACCUMULATE, CAP

- **PaymentEnvelope** - Tracks liability payment reserves
  - Links to liability accounts
  - Methods for charge/payment/credit tracking

- **BudgetAllocation** - Audit trail of monthly allocations
- **EnvelopeTransaction** - Audit trail of every balance change

  - `budget_envelope_id: Optional[str]` (line 540)
  - `payment_envelope_id: Optional[str]` (line 541)

---

#### `/projects/accounting/models/__init__.py` (UPDATED)
Exported new models for public API:
- BudgetEnvelope
- PaymentEnvelope

## Architecture Decisions

### 1. Virtual Not Physical
Envelopes are NOT accounts in Chart of Accounts. They are separate entities that track metadata about how money in real accounts is allocated.

**Why:** Eliminates fake money movement transactions, keeps bank balances accurate, simplifies reconciliation.

---

### 2. Two Envelope Types
Separate Budget Envelopes (expenses) from Payment Envelopes (liabilities).

**Why:** Different purposes and behaviors. Budget decreases when expense recorded. Payment increases when liability increases, decreases when paid.

---

### 3. Link Envelopes at Account Level
ChartOfAccounts records have `budget_envelope_id` and `payment_envelope_id` fields.

**Why:** Automatic envelope updates without manually specifying envelope on every transaction. Single source of truth for account-envelope relationships.

---

### 4. Envelope References Also on Distribution
Distribution records can override account-level envelope links.

**Why:** Flexibility for split transactions, temporary reassignments, or one-off changes.

---

### 5. Complete Audit Trail
Every envelope change creates an EnvelopeTransaction record.

**Why:** Full traceability, debugging, reporting, compliance.

---

### 6. Service Layer Pattern
Business logic in EnvelopeService, not in models.

**Why:** Separation of concerns, easier testing, reusable across different interfaces (API, CLI, GUI).

---

### 7. Fundamental Equation Validation
Every operation validates: Bank = Budget + Payment + Available

**Why:** Early detection of errors, data integrity, confidence in reporting.

---

## Transaction Flow Examples

### Cash Purchase
```
Buy $125.50 groceries with cash

1. Bank Account: FROM $125.50 → -$125.50
2. Grocery Expense: TO $125.50 → +$125.50
3. Budget Envelope "Groceries": -$125.50 (virtual)

Result:
- Bank: -$125.50
- Budget Allocated: -$125.50
- Payment Reserved: unchanged
- Available: unchanged
```

---

### Credit Card Purchase
```
Buy $245.67 groceries on credit card

1. Credit Card Liability: FROM $245.67 → +$245.67
2. Grocery Expense: TO $245.67 → +$245.67
3. Budget Envelope "Groceries": -$245.67 (virtual)
4. Payment Envelope "Credit Card": +$245.67 (virtual)

Result:
- Bank: unchanged
- Budget Allocated: -$245.67
- Payment Reserved: +$245.67
- Available: unchanged (budget down, payment up equally)
```

---

### Credit Card Payment
```
Pay $500 on credit card

1. Bank Account: FROM $500 → -$500
2. Credit Card Liability: TO $500 → -$500
3. Payment Envelope "Credit Card": -$500 (virtual)

Result:
- Bank: -$500
- Budget Allocated: unchanged
- Payment Reserved: -$500
- Available: unchanged (bank down, payment down equally)
```

---

## Next Steps (Not Implemented)

The following features were designed but NOT implemented:

### 1. Database Persistence
Current implementation uses in-memory dictionaries. Need to add:
- Database schema/migrations
- Repository pattern for data access
- SQLAlchemy models or similar

### 2. REST API Endpoints
Add HTTP endpoints for:
- Creating/updating envelopes
- Posting transactions
- Viewing balances
- Running forecasts

### 3. Envelope Transfer
Manual reallocation between budget envelopes:
```python
transfer_between_envelopes(
    from_envelope_id="1500-Groceries",
    to_envelope_id="1510-Dining",
    amount=50.00
)
```

### 4. Budget Templates
Save and reuse budget configurations:
```python
template = create_budget_template(name="Monthly Budget")
apply_template(template_id, target_month="2025-02")
```

### 5. Envelope History/Snapshots
Track envelope balances over time for trending:
```python
get_envelope_history(
    envelope_id="1500",
    start_date=date(2025, 1, 1),
    end_date=date(2025, 3, 31)
)
```

### 6. Multi-Currency Support
Support envelopes in different currencies.

### 7. Shared Envelopes
Joint budgets for households:
```python
create_shared_envelope(
    name="Household Groceries",
    contributors=["user1", "user2"]
)
```

### 8. Budget Goals and Alerts
Set targets and get notifications:
```python
create_budget_goal(
    envelope_id="1500",
    target_amount=800.00,
    alert_at_percent=80
)
```

### 9. Reconciliation Integration
Link envelopes to bank reconciliation.

### 10. Account Balance Forecasting
Extend forecasting to project actual account balances (not just envelopes) on future dates by combining:
- Current balance
- Recurring transactions
- Budget allocations (expected spending)
- Scheduled payments
